What this generator does (very simple)

Makes little fake events — each event has an id, a time, a number (value), and a type (click/view/purchase).
It can do two things with each event:
Print the event as a JSON line to the terminal (console).
Send the event over the network to anyone who connects (TCP socket).
It repeats forever at a speed you choose (events per second).


How it works, step by step :

pick a random id (like a short secret name).
get the current time (when the event happened).
choose a random value (a number) and a random type (click/view/purchase).
put those pieces into a JSON string like {"id":"abc","ts":"...","value":12.3,"type":"click"}.
if console is on → print the JSON line.
if socket is enabled → send the JSON line to every connected client.
wait a little bit depending on the rate, then do it again.
Important knobs you can change

--rate: how many events per second (higher = more events).
--no-console: stop printing to the screen.
--socket: turn on the TCP server so other programs (like Spark) can connect.
--host and --port: which address and port the server listens on (default 127.0.0.1:9999).
Quick example (what you’d do)

Start generator with socket: python genrator_single.py --socket
Start a consumer (another program) that connects to 127.0.0.1:9999 to receive the events.
That’s it — it’s a tiny fake-event factory that prints and/or streams JSON lines.
